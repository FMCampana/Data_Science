### Calculate the 95% confidence interval (with a Z- (NORMAL) DISTRIBUTION)
### of the difference of the means of the collections stored in obs1 and obs2
### NOTE: Specifically find the CI for the mean of obs1 - mean of obs2
### Assign the lower bound as a number to "lower" and the upper bound as a number to "upper"
### Answers will be tested to three decimal places
